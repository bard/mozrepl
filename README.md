============

## Important Notice

**Key technologies upon which MozRepl depends will be retired from the Mozilla platform in November 2017**. If you are relying on MozRepl, please investigate migration paths. The last known compatible version is Firefox 54.

## What is it

MozRepl is an extension for Firefox and other Mozilla applications. It listens on a TCP port for connections (by default localhost only) and responds with a shell where you can evaluate JavaScript code, in the browser context as well as in web pages.
